The bacon was crispy, salty, and filled with flavor. The Italian sausage was bursting with flavor as well. The mozzarella was top notch, not too much, not too little. Crust: B. The crust was thin and tasty, but towards the middle of the large pie, the crust was soggy. Perhaps because of the size of the pizza and number of toppings. The top of the pizza was still well cooked, charred, and crisp, but the center definitely needed more time. I wouldn't say the pizza was as good as Sally's, but the service was certainly way better. We will definitely be back again in the future, and next time we will order either small or medium pizzas and hope the center of the crust is crispier.\",\n",

For me the food is awesome, but the green sauce is the cherry on the top. Favorite meals I FREQUENTLY get are the 1/2 chicken meal, the chicken taquitos, and the potato with chicken. My wife likes the chicken flautas, and chicken quesadilla. Sometimes they will sneak me some free green sauce when I order 3-4 extra on the side!! Our only recommended growth is the refried beans. The charro beans they offer are SUPER good, but the refried beans they offer could use some work.'],\n",

We had a party of 6 so split the calamari, shrimp and sausages - all enjoyed thoroughly (and forgot the pics because it was so good!). Fresh bread and cornbread accompanied the meal. We all chose either the lamb or the drum - and all enjoyed! Lamb was cooked perfectly, as was the fish. Desserts - we had the banana pie, bread pudding, cheese board, and tres leches cake. The desserts were good, but I wasn't as happy with the pie. I'm not sure if the recipe changed over the years, but I like more of a pudding/custard pie with smaller slices of banana.

I appreciate your response, but as you can clearly see from my photo, that tin foil viewed within the image of the Flamemato appetizer is in fact tortillas.

I then got the fish taco and the carne asada quesadilla. For the sides I got the fried yuca  and the  grilled vegetables.

A mixture of mayo, corn, parmesan and cotija cheeses and possibly crema. Delicious and creamy it got us excited for what was to come. This time my wife ordered the \"most popular burger\" The Hells Kitchen Burger. I ordered off the signature side and grabbed The Hog Burger. Both burgers were well crafted with all the quality ingredients and techniques expected out of a Ramsey establishment. Wife\\'s burger was like a high end burger you could find most places, maybe slightly better. My burger was pork, pulled pork and bacon in a huge patty with cheese and onion straws I believe. It was a burger that once you pick up, you can\\'t put down because it was so good and also because it was falling apart. The onion rings were light and crispy and came with forgettable dipping sauces. I understand the place is called Burger, but I really wished to see them branch out more on the menu  and offer some different types of food. I recommend this place  but it comes off more like an \"order at the counter\" burger place than a sit down restaurant showing off one of the food world\\'s greatest talents.'],\n",

The sauce bar has many items other Mongolian BBQ restaurants lack, such as sesame oil, garlic broth, cooking sherry, and hot chili oil. The cooks here are excellent, they will even take special requests like \"crispy noodles\" or \"add red pepper flakes\" having them cooked on the grill rather than added afterwards, or even fry your rice with the food. They will also clean and prep the grill for those with seafood or peanut allergies. Another thing HuHot offers that others don\\'t, is a selection of 3 noodle types, including ramen, & pad thai flat rice noodles. The asian salad included with dinner is a spring salad with crushed ramen noodles on top, a sweet asian vinaigrette, and a few mandarin wedges. Its a salad I\\'ve only seen one place come close to replicating. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like mongolian BBQ.'],\n",

Apparently a long time argument has been going on about who the original creator of the Puffy Taco is. So having grown up in San Antonio, and eaten puffy tacos at about a half dozen places, I decided to give this place a try. I was here for the food though, specifically puffy tacos. The menu contained a variety of your regular Mexican plates, and shortly after ordering, my plate of puffy tacos along with a little basket of chips and salsa arrived. The actual puffy taco here were a little different from other places I'd had them. Many places the taco is doughy, thicker with a flaky outside and moist corn center. Rays tacos were thinner shells, inflated up while frying with little to no center, however a bit chewier than other places. Other than the minor difference in the shell, the picadillo meat, and toppings of (cheese, lettuce, & chopped tomato) were much on par with the puffy tacos I've had many a place. Overall, the tacos were good, the service OK, and the prices fair, but the location is buried a bit on the west side. Its an out of the way location if your not in the neighborhood, but seeing how Ray's is a long local establishment, its worth a trip to check out the place the Puffy Taco started.\"],\n",

The shrimp cocktail is one of the best I ever had with quality shrimp, great texture of the sauce, and a flavor that is bold yet sweet. More avocado would have made the dish absolutely the best I ever had versus one of the best. Quesadillas are great size and stuffed full on ingredients. Enchiladas with red sauce are a great smooth texture, made fresh, and have a sauce that is bold with a tad of sweetness. And fried ice cream is there along with other more traditional desserts to end your dinner on a pleasant note. This has become my 'go to' for my Mexican craving.\"],\n",

Just like the other reviews say don't bother with the bread that comes at the table it is cold and might as well get garlic bread if you want bread because it is delicious and garlic makes everything better! I really enjoy the tomato basil mozzarella appetizer and the combo plate appetizer that has everything you can possibly try and want more of. It came with muscles and a really interesting sauce in the middle that was cheesy and had a really good texture with a few crackers to pair in a lovely way. Like I predicted we had leftovers left from the amazing lasagna, prime rib steak with grilled vegetables and seafood pasta. we were all stuffed we also got a Cabernet which was perfect with all the meats that we had to get through at the table.\"]]},\n",

I enjoyed the gnocchi the most because they cooked it really well the seasoning in the bolognese was delicious. The orecchiette and pappardelle were very good as well. Highly recommend this place if you want awesome quality pasta and Italian food overall.'],\n",

I ordered the chicken tenders with a mild spice level and a side is coleslaw. The chicken was cooked perfectly, it was juicy yet crispy at the same time--very similar to Korean Fried Chicken. Each bite was a mix of paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper baked into the crust. The coleslaw was also well done. Creamy dressing yet filled with good shreds of cabbage, carrots, and celery. The final good touch was the large slice of white bread that the chicken was placed on.\",\n",

We started off with the small treasures of the reef starter and 2 apps - bang bang cauliflower and calamari. The treasures of the reef was a plate with 4 pieces of cocktail shrimp, 4 oysters & 4 raw clams, and 2 lobster tails. It was just the right amount of fresh raw seafood for us (party of 4). The bang bang cauliflower is so so good! It's a deep fried cauliflower tossed is some sort of sweet & spicy chili sauce. The calamari was okay. If you like clam chowder you need to try it. It came with a side of salad which paired nicely with the crab cakes. The crab cakes are not huge but decently sized. It's super soft and consists of chunks of crab.\",\n",

No deep frying necessary (you don't typically fry these kind of rice rolls and only prepare/activate them by dipping them in water). I ordered Beef top round pho and instead got pork. I've had far better pho. The portion sizes are plentiful however pho noodles are supposed to be free floating in the broth.

The Wrigley Field Burger came with bacon (always a plus) and all the burgers had a lettuce, tomato, and pickle spear on the side.

Second time I got the catfish shrimp combo with fried cucumber, hush puppies, and a cup of gumbo. The cod was flavorless and Could easily tell it was cheap Walmart type cod. The catfish seemed like it came straight  from the lake. The shrimp was the only thing that was of good quality but the batter brought the taste down. Everything(the cod, catfish, shrimp, cucumber, and okra) was fried with the same homemade type fish batter. Don't get me wrong, The batter isn't bad but it gets tiring when everything tastes like it. The fries tasted straight like fish like if it's all fried in the same oil. The gumbo was OK. It was very light and more of a soup. It was missing a lot of Cajun spices. Did get a good amount of shrimp and veggies. Some of the okra was good and some was woody where I had to spit the skin out.\",\n",

The fries were so crispy despite being covered in a cheesy truffle sauce. I had the crab Benedict, which came with breakfast potatoes and was made of blue crab. We ended the meal with the pot du creme - highly recommend getting this. It was very smooth, almost like a mousse, and contested with a smattering of coarse sea salt on the top. There were fresh berries that popped in your mouth that accompanied it, and it came in three dollops.'],\n",

Liberty duck: The best way to describe it would be if you combined the crispy skin of Peking duck with the meat of holiday ham, nestled next to wild rice pilaf with a sweet XO sauce.

Theres traditional Greek desserts like baklavas the size of my palm and other pastries like cakes and tarts. We ended up getting the strawberry shortcake and a walnut baklava. The barista there was also very funny and asked a lot of questions to make sure we got the flavor we wanted from our iced Greek coffees (I got sweet with milk, my friend got black). The strawberry shortcake was light and fluffy, and had real strawberry pieces inside. There was a fair amount of white frosting but it wasnt overly sweet. It was sweetened with a generous portion of honey and the crushed walnuts lent such a lovely texture against the phyllo dough. The bill was ~$23 for the two frappes and two desserts.

Theyre the size of my palm and have big round chunks of chocolate embedded throughout. Depending on the batch, they can either be pretty crispy but I like them best when theyre slight chewy.

The salt and pepper chicken is also a solid bet if you want to get it in a salad or plate.
