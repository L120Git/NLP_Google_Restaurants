The bacon was crispy, salty, and filled with flavor. The Italian sausage was bursting with flavor as well. The mozzarella was top notch, not too much, not too little. Crust: B. The crust was thin and tasty, but towards the middle of the large pie, the crust was soggy. Perhaps because of the size of the pizza and number of toppings. The top of the pizza was still well cooked, charred, and crisp, but the center definitely needed more time. I wouldn't say the pizza was as good as Sally's, but the service was certainly way better. We will definitely be back again in the future, and next time we will order either small or medium pizzas and hope the center of the crust is crispier.\",\n",

We had a party of 6 so split the calamari, shrimp and sausages - all enjoyed thoroughly (and forgot the pics because it was so good!). Fresh bread and cornbread accompanied the meal. We all chose either the lamb or the drum - and all enjoyed! Lamb was cooked perfectly, as was the fish. Desserts - we had the banana pie, bread pudding, cheese board, and tres leches cake. The desserts were good, but I wasn't as happy with the pie. I'm not sure if the recipe changed over the years, but I like more of a pudding/custard pie with smaller slices of banana.

I had the OMG Burger and it definitely lived up to it's name, packed a punch of flavor cooked perfectly to medium rare, the sauce and toppings complimented eachother perfectly, the garlic herb fries tasted very good. My wife had the fish and chips with sweet potatoe fries the batter on the fish was just the right thickness, crispy and the fish was still moist inside. Her apple coleslaw was also very tasty. We finished the evening with the bread pudding that had a nice crisp firm top, still piping hot inside and served with ice cream.\"]]},\n",

I appreciate your response, but as you can clearly see from my photo, that tin foil viewed within the image of the Flamemato appetizer is in fact tortillas. Trying to fill the chip-empty whole in my heart, I ordered their Flamemato appetizer that's advertised as mushrooms and chorizo, but It came out as lackluster chili on a tortilla that couldn't hold itself together. I then got the fish taco and the carne asada quesadilla. For the sides I got the fried yuca  and the  grilled vegetables. The fish taco was downright amazing and had I gone to this restaurant and just got fish tacos I would have left it with 5 stars.\"],\n",

A mixture of mayo, corn, parmesan and cotija cheeses and possibly crema. Delicious and creamy it got us excited for what was to come. This time my wife ordered the \"most popular burger\" The Hells Kitchen Burger. I ordered off the signature side and grabbed The Hog Burger. Both burgers were well crafted with all the quality ingredients and techniques expected out of a Ramsey establishment. Wife\\'s burger was like a high end burger you could find most places, maybe slightly better. My burger was pork, pulled pork and bacon in a huge patty with cheese and onion straws I believe. It was a burger that once you pick up, you can\\'t put down because it was so good and also because it was falling apart. The onion rings were light and crispy and came with forgettable dipping sauces. I understand the place is called Burger, but I really wished to see them branch out more on the menu  and offer some different types of food. I recommend this place  but it comes off more like an \"order at the counter\" burger place than a sit down restaurant showing off one of the food world\\'s greatest talents.'],\n",

The menu has a huge variety of rolls including creme cheese rolls, tempura fried rolls, rolls with shrimp, crab, salmon, tuna, and at the time of my first visit even one with beef bulgogi style meat in it. We had edamame and miso soup as an appetizer, gyoza between rolls, and green tea ice cream to finish. Everything was amazing, fresh, and was some of the best sushi I\\'d ever had. If your a sushi fan, and visiting the Colorado Springs area this is a must stop for you. Dessert is still included, new rolls have been added to the menu including a very unique \"Hunka Hunka burning love\" roll made from a hollowed jalapeno instead of seaweed paper. I did not see the bulgogi roll anymore however.'],\n",

The sauce bar has many items other Mongolian BBQ restaurants lack, such as sesame oil, garlic broth, cooking sherry, and hot chili oil. The cooks here are excellent, they will even take special requests like \"crispy noodles\" or \"add red pepper flakes\" having them cooked on the grill rather than added afterwards, or even fry your rice with the food. They will also clean and prep the grill for those with seafood or peanut allergies. Another thing HuHot offers that others don\\'t, is a selection of 3 noodle types, including ramen, & pad thai flat rice noodles. The asian salad included with dinner is a spring salad with crushed ramen noodles on top, a sweet asian vinaigrette, and a few mandarin wedges. Its a salad I\\'ve only seen one place come close to replicating. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like mongolian BBQ.'],\n",

Apparently a long time argument has been going on about who the original creator of the Puffy Taco is. So having grown up in San Antonio, and eaten puffy tacos at about a half dozen places, I decided to give this place a try. I was here for the food though, specifically puffy tacos. The menu contained a variety of your regular Mexican plates, and shortly after ordering, my plate of puffy tacos along with a little basket of chips and salsa arrived. The actual puffy taco here were a little different from other places I'd had them. Many places the taco is doughy, thicker with a flaky outside and moist corn center. Rays tacos were thinner shells, inflated up while frying with little to no center, however a bit chewier than other places. Other than the minor difference in the shell, the picadillo meat, and toppings of (cheese, lettuce, & chopped tomato) were much on par with the puffy tacos I've had many a place. Overall, the tacos were good, the service OK, and the prices fair, but the location is buried a bit on the west side. Its an out of the way location if your not in the neighborhood, but seeing how Ray's is a long local establishment, its worth a trip to check out the place the Puffy Taco started.\"],\n",

I've never tried their fried baskets but they look good. 50 cents per red potato??? The one time my bf and I opted for the bbq sausage (better value) instead of the boiled sausage, they were out.

We started off with the small treasures of the reef starter and 2 apps - bang bang cauliflower and calamari. The treasures of the reef was a plate with 4 pieces of cocktail shrimp, 4 oysters & 4 raw clams, and 2 lobster tails. It was just the right amount of fresh raw seafood for us (party of 4). The bang bang cauliflower is so so good! It's a deep fried cauliflower tossed is some sort of sweet & spicy chili sauce. The calamari was okay. If you like clam chowder you need to try it. It came with a side of salad which paired nicely with the crab cakes. The crab cakes are not huge but decently sized. It's super soft and consists of chunks of crab.\",\n",

The pretty pictures show that Pho Vietnam does not fail on presentation. You can buy the translucent rice paper for $2 at the Asian Market (literally across the street). You cut up cucumbers, cilantro and carrots and wrap them up and bam. You've got a vietnamese vegetarian spring roll. No deep frying necessary (you don't typically fry these kind of rice rolls and only prepare/activate them by dipping them in water). I ordered Beef top round pho and instead got pork. I've had far better pho. The portion sizes are plentiful however pho noodles are supposed to be free floating in the broth. These noodles were lumped together and sticking together like a large blob of paste in the bottom of the bowl.

The mozzarella sticks had a nice bit of crunch and paired well with the housemade marinara. The aglio y olio, surprisingly hard to find elsewhere, packed a garlicky punch while the fettuccini offered well-cooked shrimp in a slightly sweet pink crab sauce, another rarity. While tiramisu is a whole lot more ubiquitous, Amalfis rendition held up well. The two entrees were $13 and $21, respectively, but both came with a choice of soup or salad as well as bread. Only the mozzarella sticks, at $9.49, felt like a reach.

The veggie burger was hearty and full of flavor though a tad bit dry. The fries were my favorite - theyre Belgian style and so tasty. We all preferred the fries over our burgers. The Blake Burger came with green chilies that were more salty than flavorful. The Wrigley Field Burger came with bacon (always a plus) and all the burgers had a lettuce, tomato, and pickle spear on the side. The English muffin in lieu of a burger bun seems like a good idea in theory as it holds the patty more firmly but it was also a bit dryer. I like that the beef is grass fed but it also means that the more well-cooked it is, the dryer the meat becomes.'],\n",

House made pasta - I was a bit disappointed but it was still high quality pasta with good texture (cooked al dente). Sweet and spicy glazed duck leg - has an XO sauce and is apparently Szechuan-inspired. Cornbread - underwhelming - I preferred the free house bread rolls provided at the start of the meal. Crispy catfish - came in two pieces and lightly breaded & fried. Flat iron steak - recommended to be medium rare. Reminds me of the Diddy Riese one. Its on the more bitter side and the accompanying biscotti is surprisingly spicy (I liked its unexpected nature). Drinks - The Papa holiday tasted like grapefruit, while the fist of berries has a licorice taste.'],\n",

Second time I got the catfish shrimp combo with fried cucumber, hush puppies, and a cup of gumbo. The cod was flavorless and Could easily tell it was cheap Walmart type cod. The catfish seemed like it came straight  from the lake. The shrimp was the only thing that was of good quality but the batter brought the taste down. Everything(the cod, catfish, shrimp, cucumber, and okra) was fried with the same homemade type fish batter. Don't get me wrong, The batter isn't bad but it gets tiring when everything tastes like it. The fries tasted straight like fish like if it's all fried in the same oil. The gumbo was OK. It was very light and more of a soup. It was missing a lot of Cajun spices. Did get a good amount of shrimp and veggies. Some of the okra was good and some was woody where I had to spit the skin out.\",\n",

We split a Greg Norman cheeseburger (its hard to resist wagyu) (~$20) and a Brooklyn Blackout shake (~$15)The shake came out first, and it was massive. Be careful when you try to take the brownie out because it almost completely fell to the table when we tried to take a bite, so we ended up just putting them on a plate and eating it alongside the shake. The shake is super thick, and we mostly just ate it like it was regular ice cream. I thought the brownie was a bit dry, but I really liked scraping the chocolate chips with the Nutella from the side of the glass. The burger was large and already cut in half so it was easy to split - a solid burger, and we did like having it medium rare. The fries were more thickly cut and came with ketchup on the side.'],\n",

Cavatelli: My favorite dish - the pasta was perfectly squishy and the pork sugo was well seasoned with Calabrian chilis. Parker rolls: Yes its $6 for bread, but its worth it. The rolls are so soft and chewy, and we fought over the last bits of date butter that came with it. Liberty duck: The best way to describe it would be if you combined the crispy skin of Peking duck with the meat of holiday ham, nestled next to wild rice pilaf with a sweet XO sauce. Wild boar: Definitely not a boar-ing dish. The meat was tender and the gnocchi mixed with greens dripping in a mustard jus was interesting but comforting.'],\n",

The woman working behind the counter was very funny - when I asked her what the best pastry was, she said they all were. Theres traditional Greek desserts like baklavas the size of my palm and other pastries like cakes and tarts. We ended up getting the strawberry shortcake and a walnut baklava. The barista there was also very funny and asked a lot of questions to make sure we got the flavor we wanted from our iced Greek coffees (I got sweet with milk, my friend got black). The strawberry shortcake was light and fluffy, and had real strawberry pieces inside. There was a fair amount of white frosting but it wasnt overly sweet. It was sweetened with a generous portion of honey and the crushed walnuts lent such a lovely texture against the phyllo dough. The bill was ~$23 for the two frappes and two desserts. Its authentic, family-owned, the desserts are delicious, and the coffee is strong - what more do you want?'],\n",

You can order whole pies in advance for about $40 I believe. I have also tried the Earl Grey pie, pumpkin pie, and chess pie, but my heart belongs to the Mexican chocolate pie.

The vegan brownie is surprisingly good and has bits of peanut brittle that add a bit more interesting texture to an otherwise very soft brownie ($4). I also love the chocolate chip cookies - I think theyre some of the best and I love it whenever our office caters tender greens (TG as its affectionately known) and theres leftover chocolate chip cookies to munch on. Theyre the size of my palm and have big round chunks of chocolate embedded throughout. Depending on the batch, they can either be pretty crispy but I like them best when theyre slight chewy. Another favorite of mine is the buttermilk fried chicken - its not as heavy as you think and you could always get it in a salad. The salt and pepper chicken is also a solid bet if you want to get it in a salad or plate. You order at the cash register and move down the line sideways, then you have the option of getting drinks and dessert. The kombucha is $5 and its tall glass of pink fizziness. Green juice is $3.5 and is decent. Theres also wine for $7 if youre looking to have some alcohol. The blueberry dessert is really moist and light.'],\n",
